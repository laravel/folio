# Laravel Folio

- Laravel Folio is a powerful page-based router that simplifies routing in Laravel applications.
- Routes are generated automatically by creating Blade templates in `resources/views/pages`.
- IMPORTANT: Activate 'folio-routing' when working with Folio, pages, routes, route parameters, model binding, middleware, or `resources/views/pages`.
